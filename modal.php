				<h3 class="text-center text-secondary">Our Online Marketing Process</h3><br>
				<div><h4 class="text-center text-secondary">Planning and strategizing</h4><br>
					<p>Every business is different. Our very first step is to analyze your industry vertical, understand your business, its unique marketing requirements and study the competitive landscape. Our internet marketing professionals perform an extensive research that includes the study of the data from your site’s analytics, backlink portfolio analysis, keyword research, competitor analysis and lots more. All this data is then used to develop an outline of the marketing campaign.</p><br>
					<h4 class="text-center text-secondary">Quality Traffic</h4><br>
					<p>There is a significant difference between high volumes of traffic and ‘quality’ traffic. Our marketing efforts are directed towards driving quality traffic to your website – essentially, the users who are most likely to use your products or services are targeted. In this way, we can ensure that the traffic we drive to your business will most likely engage with your website and take action and eventually convert.</p><br>
					<h4 class="text-center text-secondary">Conversions and Customer Retention</h4><br>
					<p>Driving traffic to your site is of no use unless the website is optimized to give these users what they expect and more. The user experience and interaction with your site decide whether the visitor stays or browses away. Our marketing experts help optimize your website to ensure that there is an appropriate ‘call to action’ such as a form to fill or a purchase button or some other desired action. These are essential elements to improve conversion rates. A customer must not be lost once he has successfully landed on your page. On the other hand, it is also important to keep constant communication with your existing customers. Our marketing experts ensure this by using re-marketing and other techniques.</p><br>
					<h4 class="text-center text-secondary">Our Online Marketing Solutions Include:</h4><br>
					<ol>
						<li><p class="text-weight">SEO Consulting –</p> During a consultation, our professionals examine your website, provide expert analysis and provide you with detailed reports on how to fix issues if any.</li>
						<li><p class="text-weight">Keyword Research –</p>Keywords are by far the most important elements of online marketing. We perform a thorough keyword research to ensure that all marketing efforts are highly targeted to your potential market. Selecting the right keywords ensure that your business gets its deserved rankings, visibility and presence online.</li>
						<li><p class="text-weight">On-page Optimization –</p>A detailed audit of your website is carried out to identify issues such as broken links, sparse content or the use of relevant keywords, etc. Fixing these on-page issues is a priority, and we ensure that this is the very first step in the process. We also ensure that images, videos and content is optimized as per the general SEO guidelines.</li>
						<li><p class="text-weight">Web Analytics – </p>We analyse your website with the help of powerful tools such as Google Analytics etc. and prepare detailed reports that provide you with insights into the current status of your site, future opportunities and potential pitfalls. Competitor analysis, target audience and market share provides enough data to formulate a long term strategy for your business. We also make recommendations such as changes in web design, keywords or content.</li>
